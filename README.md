go-spellcheck
============

This is an implementation of Peter Norvig's spell correction algorithm in Golang. You can read more about the algorithm here. http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html

This implementation is multithread-safe and looks little like Norvig's implementation, but the underlying algorithm is the same.
